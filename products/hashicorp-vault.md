> [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/) is a tool for securely accessing secrets. It
> provides a unified interface to any secret, while providing tight access control and recording a
> detailed audit log.

- **Generally Available (GA)** support of the latest minor release. [Community versions](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault/issues/28471#issuecomment-2393714603)
end when the next release occurs. While the [Enterprise versions](https://support.hashicorp.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021185113-Support-Period-and-End-of-Life-EOL-Policy)
have extended support.

- [**Long-Term-Support (LTS)**](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/enterprise/lts)
releases offer extended maintenance through minor releases for select,
major **Vault Enterprise** releases. The latest 2 LTS releases are supported at any given time,
following an N-1 policy.

Since Vault has 3 releases every year, this results in approximately 1 year of
standard maintenance, followed by one year of extended maintenance for the LTS
releases.

## Maintenance Levels

- **Standard Maintenance** includes new features, bug fixes, and security patches to the
  latest minor version.
- **Extended Maintenance** (only available for LTS releases for Vault Enterprise customers) only includes
  patches for bugs that may cause outages and critical vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs).

## Versioning and Release Cadence

A major release is identified by a change in the first (X) or second (Y) digit in the following
versioning nomenclature: `Version X.Y.Z.` Vault typically has 3 major releases every year. LTS releases
overlap by one year, allowing upgrade time for Enterprise customers. Upgrading from version LTS to LTS+1
may require transitional upgrades to move through the intermediate Vault versions.
